# NLP Text Summary  

## The summarization technique used in the above example is "Abstractive Summarization"

## What is this Abstractive Summarization ?

Abstractive summarization is a technique that generates new sentences and phrases that capture the meaning of the original text, rather than simply extracting existing sentences.
The BART model used in this application is an example of an abstractive summarization model.
It is trained on a large dataset of text and learns to generate summaries that are coherent and fluent, while still accurately conveying the main points of the original text. 
This technique is less exact than extractive summarization but more human like, as it generates new phrases.

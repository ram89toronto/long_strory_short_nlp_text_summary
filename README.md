## The summarization technique used in the above example is "Abstractive Summarization"

 Happy to build this "Long Story Short !!!" an NLP summarizing app for busy professionals, students, and entrepreneurs.

### Simplifies day-to-day tasks such as 
	"What was the meeting about ?" 
	"Can you summarize this lengthy email ?"
	"What is this article about ?"
	"Can tell shorten the executive summary ?"

### I think these are problems are same for both us, I built this app to solve this problem using NLP techniques 

1. Fast skimming of multiple emails, articles, information 
2. It saves time to skim not-so-important articles
3. Allows you to write shorter emails shorter 
4. Enables you to make informed decisions
5. Listen back and recollect the summary 

Lets do it in 3 Simple Steps !!!


Note: Abstractive summarization is  a technique that generates new sentences and phrases that capture the meaning of the original text, rather than simply extracting existing sentences. The BART model used in this application is an example of an abstractive summarization model.
It is trained on a large dataset of text and learns to generate summaries that are coherent and fluent, while still accurately conveying the main points of the original text. This technique is less exact than extractive summarization but more human like, as it generates new phrases.
